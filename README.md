# CODE-FOR-A-DAY
 "CODE for a day" is a personal initiative aimed at dedicating a significant portion of the day to coding-related activities, such as learning new concepts, working on coding exercises or projects, reviewing code, and seeking feedback. The goal is to improve coding skills through consistent practice and focused effort.
